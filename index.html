                <p class="para">
                    On 17 December 2016, the Government of India appointed Rawat as the 27th Chief of the Army Staff, 
                    superseding two more senior Lieutenant Generals, Praveen Bakshi and P. M. Hariz. 
                    The appointment made by NDA ruled Government was politically controversial.
                    Rawat was accused of nepotism and gratuitously politicising the appointment, 
                    by the senior serving and retired military officers.
